			<!-- About -->
			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I have been a professional makeup artist for 20 years. I adore looking after my clients for their
					wedding day and special occasions. My clients would usually describe me as calm, professional and
					passionate about what I do. </p>

				<p> I initially began my creative journey training in interior design but with both my parents having a
					background in the cosmetic industry I suppose it was inevitable I had a natural interest and flare
					for makeup. I have worked with Mac Cosmetics as an artist, a store manager and a regional trainer
					throughout my 15 years with the brand. </p>

				<p> During that time I have had the privilege of working on so many faces while working on the store
					counters and traveling to fashion capitals to support International Fashion Weeks in London and
					Milan. </p>
